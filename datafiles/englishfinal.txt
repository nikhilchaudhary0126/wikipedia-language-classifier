en|The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is
en|nearly 35 metres high which is close in measurement to the length of the base,

en|of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud. The top
en|is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. The shape
en|of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris placed at its corners, which
en|replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical. Their columned
en|bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall
en|decorative spires extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height
en|of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The

en|a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. The domes and vaults of the
en|sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone
en|inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in
en|sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the
en|marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex
en|array of geometric patterns. Floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns.
en|On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas
en|relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite
en|detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra
en|dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. The inlay stones are
en|of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and levelled to the surface of the walls.
en|The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay
en|work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones. The inner
en|chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face, although only
en|the door facing the garden to the south is used. The interior walls are about

en|intricate screen or jali cut from marble. In addition to the light from the balcony
en|screens, light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners. The octagonal marble
en|screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with
en|intricate pierce work. The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones forming
en|twining vines, fruits and flowers. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate

en|one of the rivers of Paradise. Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar

en|black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river. The idea originates from
en|fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665. It was
en|suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of
en|blackened marble across the river in the Mehtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend. However,
en|excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had
en|turned black. A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated
en|in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Mehtab Bagh. A

en|Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva in the form of a lingam. When Shah Jahan arrived
en|at the site upon Mumtaz's death, he demolished the temple and built the Taj Mahal
en|entirely with Muslim symbols. The actual tomb of Mumtaz never contained her body but instead
en|it contained the lingam that was at the temple site and other idols and Hindu
en|symbols of the temple were hidden and locked in a vault under the Taj Mahal.
en|Another theory suggests that Mumtaz Mahal's remains were not buried in Agra but in the
en|Ahukhana in Burhanpur. Shah Jahan had shifted base from Delhi due to the recurrent attacks
en|from his enemies. He settled down at the Shahi Quila close to the Tapti River
en|in Burhanpur sometime in the late 1620s. In the 16th century, the Mughals built the
en|Ahukhana as a sprawling garden deer park. It had a small palace where the body
en|of Mumtaz was laid to rest for about six months. Historical records state that Mumtaz
en|Mahal’s mortal remains were kept at the Ahukhana for six months after her demise. Although,
en|in its heydays, the Akhukhana was a vibrant retreat for the royal Mughals, all that
en|remains today is a neglected site overgrown with wild grass. The dead body of Mumtaz
en|Mahal was kept in a garden on the shore of Yamuna River for about 22
en|years till the completion of Taj Mahal in 1653 A. D. According to the locals
en|of Burhanpur, Shah Jahan chose to built Taj Mahal in Agra for mainly three reasons.
en|First, Burhanpur’s soil was infested with termites, and hence, it would have been impossible for
en|it to hold a magnanimous building for long. Second, the emperor wanted the reflection of
en|Taj Mahal to reflect on the river. Since, the Tapti River of Burhanpur was narrower
en|as compared to the width of the Yamuna River in Agra, Shah Jahan naturally zeroed
en|in on Agra. The third reason was Agra’s proximity to Makrana in Rajasthan from where

en|The ancient Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, is one of the
en|first major authors to mention the pyramid. In the second book of his work The
en|Histories, he discusses the history of Egypt and the Great Pyramid. This report was created
en|more than 2000 years after the structure was built, meaning that Herodotus obtained his knowledge
en|mainly from a variety of indirect sources, including officials and priests of low rank, local
en|Egyptians, Greek immigrants, and Herodotus's own interpreters. Accordingly, his explanations present themselves as a mixture
en|of comprehensible descriptions, personal descriptions, erroneous reports, and fantastical legends; as such, many of the
en|speculative errors and confusions about the monument can be traced back to Herodotus and his
en|Herodotus writes that the pyramid was built by Khufu, whom he mistakenly argues ruled sometime
en|after Ramses III of the Twentieth Dynasty. Khufu, Herodotus claims, was a tyrannical king, which
en|probably shows the view of the Greeks that such buildings can only come about through
en|cruel exploitation of the people. Herodotus further writes that on the orders of Khufu, 100,000
en|workers worked on the building in three-month shifts, taking 20 years to build. In the
en|first ten years, a wide causeway was erected, which, according to Herodotus, was almost as
en|impressive as the construction of the pyramids themselves, since it was nearly 1 kilometre long
en|and twenty yards wide, and elevated at its highest to a height of sixteen yards,
en|and it is all of stone polished and carved with figures. In addition, underground chambers
en|were made on the hill whereon the pyramids stand, meant to be burial places for

en|distanced himself from Herodotus, who Diodorus claimed described only. Diodorus presumably drew his knowledge from
en|the lost work of Hecataeus of Abdera, and like Herodotus, he also places the builder

en|finds in the structure's inner chambers. The Akbar al-zaman also contains a report of Al-Ma'mun's
en|entry into the pyramid, although the author adds that Al-Ma'mun discovered a vessel containing a

en|During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made
en|structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building
en|in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the
en|world to surpass both the 200 meter and 300 meter mark in height. Due to

en|The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two
en|senior engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about
en|a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the
en|centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from
en|the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853. In May 1884, working at
en|home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as. Eiffel initially showed
en|little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen
en|Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative
en|arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and
en|Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as president of France
en|and Édouard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was
en|passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open
en|competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of
en|Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300
en|m four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.. On 12 May, a commission was
en|set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that
en|After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on
en|8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than
en|as the representative of his company, and granted him 1. 5 million francs toward the
en|construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6. 5 million francs. Eiffel was
en|to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and
en|for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower,
en|Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south
en|legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m concrete slabs, one for
en|each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer
en|to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using
en|compressed-air caissons 15 m long and 6 m in diameter driven to a depth of
en|22 m to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m thick. Each of these
en|slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe
en|Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm in
en|diameter and 7. 5 m long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the
en|erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount
en|of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700
en|general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of
en|drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the
en|degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm
en|and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted
en|together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb
en|of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as
en|construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not
en|fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were
en|At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level
en|construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural
en|integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as and appeared in the tabloid press.
en|At this stage, a small crane designed to move up the tower was installed in
en|each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be
en|fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first
en|level was completed by the end of March 1888. Although the metalwork had been prepared
en|with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments
en|to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base
en|of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were
en|intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the
en|scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees, due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use

en|government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the
en|first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of
en|Constructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough
en|at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and
en|a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts
en|to be fitted in the east and west legs. Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a
en|pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead
en|weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most
en|of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from
en|above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom
en|of the run, the chains passed around 3. 9 m diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at
en|Installing lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track
en|was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis
en|Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out
en|the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for
en|bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract
en|was given to Otis in July 1887. Otis were confident they would eventually be given
en|The car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift
en|operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an
en|inclined hydraulic ram 12. 67 m long and 96. 5 cm in diameter in the
en|tower leg with a stroke of 10. 83 m : this moved a carriage carrying
en|six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar
en|to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston
en|rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by
en|a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the
en|water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room
en|at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts
en|The original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by
en|Léon Edoux. A pair of 81 m hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level,
en|reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top
en|of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on
en|the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half
en|the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts
en|The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31
en|March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the
en|press, to the top of the tower. Because the lifts were not yet in operation,
en|the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently
en|to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels,
en|but a few, including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon,
en|the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustré,
en|completed the ascent. At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of

en|tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the
en|exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was
en|an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to
en|the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May. Tickets cost 2 francs for
en|the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission
en|For the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced
en|by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille.
en|These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent
en|changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the
en|Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was
en|provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism. At the same time the lift in
en|the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The
en|layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors
en|on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years
en|On 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No. 6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize
en|offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight
en|from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.
en|Many innovations took place at the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th century. In 1910,
en|Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He
en|found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic
en|rays. Just two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after
en|jumping from the first level of the tower to demonstrate his parachute design. In 1914,
en|at the outbreak of World War I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed
en|German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory
en|at the First Battle of the Marne. From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citroën
en|adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world
en|at the time. In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television
en|transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line

en|wireless station. A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base
en|of the north leg on 2 May 1929. In 1930, the tower lost the title
en|of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.
en|Upon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the
en|French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were
en|not repaired until 1946. In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist

en|hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one. When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to
en|stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered
en|General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with
en|the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order. On 25 June, before the

en|with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to
en|speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past
en|him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander
en|was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of
en|Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died
en|after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this
en|Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts
en|of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was
en|poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it
en|as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for
en|the sake of completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed
en|as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot.
en|Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate
en|of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son
en|Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.
en|The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between
en|the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available.
en|However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the

en|antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. In a 2014 manuscript in the journal
en|Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would
en|produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance. Veratrum
en|album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was

en|Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if

en|supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of
en|Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at
en|the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After

en|Alexander earned the epithet due to his unparalleled success as a military commander. He never
en|lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. This was due to use of terrain, phalanx
en|and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops. The Macedonian phalanx,
en|armed with the sarissa, a spear 6 metres long, had been developed and perfected by
en|Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and manoeuvrability to great effect
en|against larger but more disparate Persian forces. Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among
en|his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally
en|In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of
en|his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of
en|40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings,
en|so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km.
en|By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would
en|not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over
en|the Persians' scimitars and javelins. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.
en|At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment,
en|and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center,
en|routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his
en|chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry
en|with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting

en|successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry

en|Some of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents. His mother had
en|huge ambitions, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian
en|Empire. Olympias's influence instilled a sense of destiny in him, and Plutarch tells how his
en|ambition. However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the
en|young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe
en|wounds. Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had
en|a need to outdo his father, illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle. While Alexander
en|worried that his father would leave him, he also downplayed his father's achievements to his
en|According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature, which
en|undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions. Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond
en|well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate. He had a
en|calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for
en|philosophy, and was an avid reader. This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's
en|tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. His intelligent and rational side was amply
en|demonstrated by his ability and success as a general. He had great self-restraint in, in
en|Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences. However, he had little interest in
en|sports or the Olympic games, seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour and glory. He
en|had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His
en|unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite
en|Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.
en|During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit
en|signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of
en|destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His
en|delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer

en|Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently
en|confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself
en|as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court,
en|notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour
en|cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic
en|ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in

en|French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he
en|was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated
en|European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series
en|of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast
en|majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its

en|ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the
en|governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In April 1796, he began his first

en|a historic triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the elimination of the
en|Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because Prussia
en|became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly knocked out Prussia at
en|the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, then marched the Grand Army deep into Eastern Europe,
en|annihilating the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, and forcing the defeated nations of the

en|of the interior. His parents Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino maintained an

en|the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy. Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defence
en|in a letter to the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.
en|He was released within two weeks and, due to his technical skills, was asked to
en|draw up plans to attack Italian positions in the context of France's war with Austria.
en|He also took part in an expedition to take back Corsica from the British, but

en|offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene. In
en|a series of rapid victories during the Montenotte Campaign, he knocked Piedmont out of the
en|war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of
en|the war, the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for Mantua. The Austrians launched
en|a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every
en|relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of Castiglione, Bassano, Arcole, and Rivoli. The decisive

en|encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian
en|territory after winning at the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed
en|by the French thrust that reached all the way to Leoben, about 100 km from
en|Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace. The Treaty of Leoben, followed by the
en|more comprehensive Treaty of Campo Formio, gave France control of most of northern Italy and
en|the Low Countries, and a secret clause promised the Republic of Venice to Austria. Bonaparte
en|marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of Venetian independence. He also
en|authorized the French to loot treasures such as the Horses of Saint Mark. On the
en|journey, Bonaparte conversed much about the warriors of antiquity especially Alexander, Caesar, Scipio and Hannibal.
en|He studied their strategy and combined it with his own. In a question from Bourrienne,
en|asking whether he gave his preference to Alexander or Caesar, Napoleon said that he places
en|Alexander The Great in the first rank, the main reason being his campaign on Asia.
en|After two months of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval strength was not yet sufficient
en|enough to confront the British Royal Navy. He decided on a military expedition to seize
en|Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India. Bonaparte wished to
en|establish a French presence in the Middle East and join forces with Tipu Sultan, the

en|followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and
en|the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the
en|two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and
en|Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of
en|40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage
en|through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say,. Frank

en|Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain. A Franco-Persian alliance was also formed

en|states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation
en|of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the
en|Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in
en|the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the
en|summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick
en|William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.
en|The initial military manoeuvres began in September 1806. In a letter to Marshal Soult detailing
en|the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced
en|the phrase le bataillon-carré. In the bataillon-carré system, the various corps of the Grande Armée
en|would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the
en|Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River
en|Saale. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements
en|from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the
en|Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the
en|twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt, fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the
en|Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king
en|proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which began to quickly disintegrate. On 14 June
en|Napoleon obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland, wiping out
en|the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle. The scale of their
en|defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Tsar Alexander
en|sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that
en|the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On
en|that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting
en|on an iconic raft on the River Niemen. The very first thing Alexander said to
en|Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, to make peace with Napoleon. Given the
en|victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms—demanding that
en|Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over
en|the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia,
en|despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the
en|map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 2,800 square kilometres called Westphalia and appointed his
en|young brother Jérôme as its monarch. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and
en|bitter antagonism that festered as the Napoleonic era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with
en|Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who
en|would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems,
en|the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him
en|After four years on the sidelines, Austria sought another war with France to avenge its
en|recent defeats. Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war
en|with Britain, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire in 1809. Frederick William of Prussia initially promised
en|to help the Austrians but reneged before conflict began. A report from the Austrian finance
en|minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809
en|if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized.
en|Although Archduke Charles warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon,
en|a stance that landed him in the so-called, he did not want to see the
en|army demobilized either. On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the

en|Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was
en|still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the
en|17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated
en|by 120 km and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed
en|the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps
en|of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the
en|Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched
en|his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the
en|resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into

en|convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000

en|180,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Charles received the French with 150,000
en|of his own men. In the ensuing Battle of Wagram, which also lasted two days,
en|Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until
en|then. Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole
en|in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat. Austrian losses were very heavy, reaching
en|well over 40,000 casualties. The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately, but
